    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>Project Illuminare grew from a mere reflection to a raging advocacy that will inspire millions. </h2>
    <p class="para1">One day, a group of friends were acting up, and suddenly, a teacher reprimanded them. That teacher told them, 
        "Don't you consider the privilege of education you are in?". 
        The group went silent, it may be simple words, but it held deep within them. This gave them space to ponder, 
        and slowly, they were building up a common thought that the educational situation is not at its best state, 
        not only locally, but also worldwide. Looking at our classmates, we realized how blessed we were, but we also 
        saw the sad reality that some are not able to have quality education because of different reasonsâ€”resources, 
        personal matters, and many more. <br><br> 
        Illuminare is an Italian word that means to enlight, and we want to share this 
        light to spark others for who they are meant to be. We want to illuminate minds, and furthermore futures.<br><br>
        Through this project, we aim to connect acquaintances, peers, teachers, friends, family, and whoever there 
        may be through a commitment: unity in the name of education. One's light could also illuminate the world.

    <p class="para1">
        I am Zuriel Jayce Denosta, a PSHS-SMC scholar from Batch 2029. I started this vision for us to help seek value in 
        education. Growing up, I was blessed enough to have quality education at the palm of my hands, but part 
        of that was also seeing other children who fell short on materials, resources, and many more that were 
        needs for education. This drove me to think on how I can help the people who need it, not only directly, 
        but also through others. In this project, we believe that every child has the potential to be their best.
